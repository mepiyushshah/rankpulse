## Step 1: Supabase Setup (5 minutes)

### Create Supabase Account & Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click "Start your project" (free, no credit card required)
3. Sign up with GitHub or email
4. Create a new project:
   - **Name**: rankpulse
   - **Database Password**: (Choose a strong password - save it!)
   - **Region**: (Choose closest to you)
   - Click "Create new project"
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for project to provision

### Run Database Schema

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy the entire contents of `supabase-schema.sql` from your project
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor
5. Click "Run" (bottom right)
6. You should see "Success. No rows returned" - this is correct!

### Get API Credentials

1. Go to **Project Settings** (gear icon, bottom left)
2. Click **API** in the sidebar
3. Copy these values (you'll need them next):
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon/public key** (the `anon public` key)
   - **service_role key** (click to reveal, then copy)

## Step 2: Groq API Setup (3 minutes)

2. Sign up (free, no credit card)
3. Click "API Keys" in left sidebar
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. Give it a name (e.g., "RankPulse")
6. Copy the API key immediately (you can't see it again!)

**Groq Free Tier:**

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (2 minutes)

1. In your project folder, copy the example env file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Open `.env.local` in your code editor

3. Paste your credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

4. Save the file

**Important:** Never commit `.env.local` to Git! It's already in `.gitignore`.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Missing Supabase environment variables"

**Solution:** Make sure you created `.env.local` and added all credentials. Restart the dev server after adding env vars.

### Issue: Supabase queries failing

**Solution:**
1. Check that you ran the SQL schema in Supabase
2. Make sure Row Level Security is enabled (it's automatic from the schema)
3. Verify your API keys are correct

### Issue: Groq API errors

**Solution:**
1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check you haven't hit rate limits (unlikely on free tier)
3. Make sure `GROQ_API_KEY` is in `.env.local` (no NEXT_PUBLIC prefix!)

### Issue: Port 3000 already in use

**Solution:** Next.js will automatically use port 3001 or 3002. Just use whatever port it shows.
